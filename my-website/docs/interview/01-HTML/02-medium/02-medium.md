<summary> What is the difference between empty tag(self closing tags) and container tag? </summary>

**Empty Tag:** In HTML empty tags are those tags which doesn't require any closing tag. Also we can open and close tag at the same place that's why we call these tags as self closing tag as well.

For Example: `<br />`

**Container Tag:** In HTML container tags are those tags which requires closing tag.

For Example: `<div></div>`

```js showLineNumbers=true
function test() {
  console.log("look " + "it " + "up");
}
```
